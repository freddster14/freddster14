# Hi there, I'm Freddy Carrillo 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a **self-taught software engineer** on an ongoing journey—currently working through the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. I just wrapped up the Node.js portion of my **Inventory App** (see below!), and I’m always excited to tackle new tech challenges.

My favorite part of coding? That dopamine rush when you finally solve a hair-pulling problem! My goal is to become a full stack engineer with the confidence to build anything from scratch.

## 💻 Top Skills & Tools
- **HTML** | **CSS** | **JavaScript** | **React** | **Node.js** | **SQL**
- Familiar with **Webpack**, **Jest**, and **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
- Everyday tools: **VS Code** & **Git** (I live in my terminal!)

## 🌟 Featured Project

### [Inventory App](https://github.com/freddster14/Inventory-App)
A practical, full-stack solution for managing inventory. This project highlights my growing skills in backend development, database integration, and scalable design.
